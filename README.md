# HABBIT-TRACKER-USING-NDJS


A habit tracker is a powerful tool that helps individuals monitor and cultivate positive behaviors in their daily lives. By using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB, I have created a robust and interactive habit tracker application.

In the front-end, HTML and CSS will be used to design the user interface, providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience. Users can view their habits, add new ones, mark completion, and track progress.

JavaScript will play a vital role in the habit tracker, enabling dynamic interactions and handling user input. It will manage the communication with the Node.js backend, handling data requests and responses in real-time.

On the backend, Node.js will serve as the runtime environment, facilitating communication between the frontend and the MongoDB database. Node.js will handle incoming requests from the frontend, perform necessary operations on the database, and return the data to be displayed.

To store user habits and related data, we'll utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. The habits and their progress will be stored as JSON-like documents, making it easy to add, update, or delete habits as needed.

Overall, the combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB provides a comprehensive and seamless solution for creating a habit tracker that helps individuals build positive routines and achieve their personal goals. Whether it's tracking exercise, reading, or any other habit,
this application will empower users to maintain consistency and stay motivated on their journey towards self-improvement.
